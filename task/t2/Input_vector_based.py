# The problems with Vector based Grounding approach are:
#   - In current solution we fetched all users once, prepared Vector store (Embed takes money) but we didn't play
#     around the point that new users added and deleted every 5 minutes. (Actually, it can be fixed, we can create once
#     Vector store and with new request we will fetch all the users, compare new and deleted with version in Vector
#     store and delete the data about deleted users and add new users).
#   - Limit with top_k (we can set up to 100, but what if the real number of similarity search 100+?)
#   - With some requests works not so perfectly. (Here we can play and add extra chain with LLM that will refactor the
#     user question in a way that will help for Vector search, but it is also not okay in the point that we have
#     changed original user question).
#   - Need to play with balance between top_k and score_threshold
# Benefits are:
#   - Similarity search by context
#   - Any input can be used for search
#   - Costs reduce
